Taking a screenshot is one of the most basic things you can do with the best Android phones. The Pixel 6 is no different, as there are quite a few different ways to take a screenshot on the Google Pixel. Along with using the traditional hardware button combinations, Google has implemented other methods for you to take a screenshot.


## Take a screenshot using the hardware buttons

* Hold down the power button on the phone's right side.
* Immediately afterward, hold down on the down volume button.
* Release both buttons at the same time.
* If you performed the combination properly, you should see a smaller version of the screen you took and a notification.

## Take a screenshot without buttons

There are several different methods to take a screenshot without using the hardware buttons. These depend on the type of navigation you are using on the Google Pixel. For reference, here are the different navigation methods available on Google Pixel:

* Gesture navigation
* 3-button navigation
* 2-button navigation (Pixel 3a or earlier)

## Take a screenshot with Gesture navigation

* Once successful, a preview will appear in the bottom left corner
